# This file is the build configuration for an aosp Android
# build for marlin hardware. This cleanly combines a set of
# device-specific aspects (drivers) with a device-agnostic
# product configuration (apps). Except for a few implementation
# details, it only fundamentally contains two inherit-product
# lines, aosp and du, hence its name.
#

# Inherit from AOSP products. Most specific first.
$(call inherit-product, device/google/marlin/aosp_sailfish.mk)

# Inherit DU product configuration
$(call inherit-product, vendor/du/config/common_full_phone.mk)

# Custom device configuration
$(call inherit-product-if-exists, vendor/google/sailfish/device-vendor-sailfish.mk)
